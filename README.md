GPS **Navigation App**

A lightweight GPS navigation application built using MIT App Inventor, designed to provide real-time location tracking, dynamic route updates, and a clean interface for easy navigation. The app leverages the device’s GPS sensor to deliver accurate coordinates and offers an accessible, beginner-friendly implementation of mobile mapping logic.

Features
	•	Real-Time GPS Tracking: Continuously fetches device coordinates to update location on-screen.
	•	Dynamic Route Display: Visual representation of the user’s current path.
	•	Interactive UI: Intuitive layout for start/stop tracking and viewing coordinates.
	•	Lightweight Design: Optimized for smooth performance on Android devices.
	•	Beginner-Friendly Implementation: Built fully on MIT App Inventor blocks with no external dependencies.

How It Works
	1.	Uses the built-in LocationSensor to capture latitude and longitude.
	2.	Displays location updates on the UI in real time.
	3.	Allows users to start or stop tracking as needed.
	4.	The app can be extended to integrate maps or route optimization since the foundation is modular.
